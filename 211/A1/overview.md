##Overview
Test application is included within the csvfile itself. I added a main function within the class object, and within that main it runs a series of tests. Each test has the expected output. I added the functionality of including own test csv file if wanted to, just pass the file as an agument and should run as need be. There are no known problems with the library, when running with my test csv file, every application and function run as expected. The be expected output should be added to each file.
